# Exercise 4 — Dijkstra Hard

Goal: Implement the algorithm using a min-priority queue (you can implement a simple binary heap or use an array-based selection for this exercise). Fill blanks in `script.js`.

What to edit:
- `script.js` — see `___________` blanks.

Hints:
- Implement a minimal priority queue with push/pop of the smallest element.
- Use the queue to avoid scanning all nodes each iteration.
