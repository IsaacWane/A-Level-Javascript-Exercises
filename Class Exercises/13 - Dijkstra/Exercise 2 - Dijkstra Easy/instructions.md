# Exercise 2 — Dijkstra Easy

Goal: Fill in one blank in `script.js` that initializes the `dist` object so all nodes start with `Infinity` except the source node.

Edit:
- `script.js` — look for `___________` and replace with the correct expression.

Hint: Use `Object.keys(graph).forEach` to set initial distances.
