# Exercise 5 — Dijkstra Assess

Assessment task: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm from scratch in `script.js`. No scaffolding. The graph is provided; ensure your algorithm returns `dist` and `prev` objects.

Success criteria:
- Correct shortest path distances for all nodes from the chosen start node.
- Reasonable performance (no infinite loops).
